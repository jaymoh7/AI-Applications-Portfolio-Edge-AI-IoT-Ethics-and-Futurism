## üß™ Part 2: Practical Implementation

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Edge AI Image Classification
- Trains a small CNN using TensorFlow.
- Dataset: Rock-Paper-Scissors (TFDS).
- Model is converted to `.tflite` and ready for deployment to edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
- **Accuracy**: ~95% (validation)

Run the script:

```bash
python edge_ai_image_classification.py
